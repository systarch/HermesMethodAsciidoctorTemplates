= Appendix

[[quality-assurance]]
== Quality Assurance

The testing details are set out in the test concept.

The tests to be carried out are listed in the Test Plan section of the project management plan.

The following test methods are used in the project.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
|Test Method |Description
a|
_Written Review_

_(WR)_

 |_Testers receive the test results by e-mail. They review the test results independently and produce a test report with their findings. The findings are either revised by the author or rejected by means of a written explanation which is sent to the tester by e-mail._
a|
_Verbal Review_

_(VR)_

 a|
_A review meeting is held to discuss the findings of the written review. At the meeting, the necessary adaptations/measures are decided and assigned, and deadlines are set._

_A written review (WR) is always the basis for a verbal review (VR)._

_A VR results in a review report, which must be signed by all VR participants._

a|
_Walk-Through_

_(WT)_

 |_A walk-through is less formal than a review. By reviewing the test results available at a specific point in time, the tester tries to get a clear picture of the current state of the work to be done._
|===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

_If test results are to be reviewed by a group of specialists, the test is conducted by written review._

[[risk-management]]
== Risk Management

Project risks are listed in the status report.

To evaluate the risks, every risk must be assessed in terms of the probability of its occurrence and its level of impact. The respective variables are set out here.

*Assessment Scale: Probability of Occurrence*

[cols=",",options="header",]
|====================================================
|Assessment |Description of Probability of Occurrence
|1 = low |_Improbable or below 20%_
|2 = medium |_Somewhat probable or 20-50%_
|3 = high |_Highly probable or above 50%_
|====================================================

*Assessment Scale: Level of Impact*

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===========================================================================================
|Assessment |Impact on Project Outcome |Impact on Deadline |Impact on Cost
|1 = low |_Minor defects_ |_Up to 1 month or minor_ |_None_
|2 = medium |_Major defects_ |_1-3 months or major_ |_5-20% or major_
|3 = high |_Critical defects_ |_More than 3 months or critical_ |_More than 20% or critical_
|===========================================================================================

This data are then used as the coordinates of a matrix to visualize the risk. The arrow (example: Risk 2) shows the change from the previous assessment.

*Risk Matrix*

Project risks that have been identified and assessed are listed in a table (such as the one shown below) in the project status report. Measures are planned to deal with every risk.

[cols=",,,,,,,",options="header",]
|=================================================================
|No. |LI |PO |RN |Description |Measure |Person in Charge |Deadline
|1 |3 |3 |9 | | | |
|2 |2 |2 |4 | | | |

[[document-management]]
== Document Management

[[document-storage]]
=== Document Storage

Tools, file location, access management

[[naming-conventions]]
=== Naming Conventions

In order for project-related documents to be clearly identifiable and easy to find, the following naming conventions are used for file names:

_Project_name_document_name.file_type_

Example:

_HMH­_project_charter.doc_

[[document-versions]]
=== Document Versions

Changes made to documents should be listed in that document's list of changes.

Use of Version Numbers

Version numbers V0.1, V0.2, V0.3... refer to versions of pending documents.

Version number V1.0 is the first accepted version of that particular document.

Version number v.1.1 is the first changed version of the document after its acceptance.

Version number V2.0 is the second accepted version of the document.

*Documents with a Time Reference*

If a document has a clear time reference, that date is included in the file name.

Example for Minutes of a Meeting:

_HMH_minutes_core_team_meeting_2011-12-05.doc_

Dates used in file names should always have a YYYY-MM-DD format to enable the files to be sorted by date.
